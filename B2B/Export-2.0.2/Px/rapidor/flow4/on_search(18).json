This deodorant provides up to 48 hours of odour protection and superior care for your delicate underarm skin. Its well-loved, delicate scent helps you feel fresh and clean all day. What more could you ask from a moisturising, antiperspirant deodorant? Its unique formula is free of alcohol* and contains ¼ moisturising cream &amp; natural oil, which gives you even softer and smoother underarm skin. This antiperspirant deodorant even helps soothe the irritation that can result from regular shaving. It's the scent and the feeling you love, with the superior underarm care and long-lasting sweat and odour protection you expect. For best results, use your deodorant spray after showering, when your skin is dry and cool. This will help your underarms absorb more product, thus staying effective longer. Shake the can well, hold it upright and 15cm away from your underarms and spray evenly on each underarm. That’s it, you are now ready to go! You can enjoy your day and rely on your deodorant to keep you smelling and feeling great all day long. Dove Original Antiperspirant Deodorant Cans are made with infinitely recyclable metal. *Alcohol refers to ethyl alcohol\" Other Information • Marketer Name and Address: Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Unilever House, B D Sawant Marg, Chakala Andheri East - 400099  • Country Of Origin: India  • Best Before: **36 Months (From date of Manufacturing)",

                "long_desc": " • \"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.The vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 &amp; above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation &amp; itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.VWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants &amp; amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation &amp; maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour &amp; irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben &amp; SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.Now don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

                "long_desc": "\"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.The vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 &amp; above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation &amp; itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.VWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants &amp; amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation &amp; maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour &amp; irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben &amp; SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.Now don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.The vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 &amp; above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation &amp; itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.VWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants &amp; amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation &amp; maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour &amp; irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben &amp; SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.Now don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\" Other Information • Marketer Name and Address: Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Unilever House, B D Sawant Marg, Chakala Andheri East - 400099  • Country Of Origin: India  • Best Before: **24 Months (From date of Manufacturing)",

Everyday damage can stress strands, leaving them prone to breakage and hair fall. Presenting New Dove Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair Conditioner is inspired by the rituals of North American women.

Combined with the superior care of Dove, the formula instantly smoothens out the hair surface, preventing frizz and keeps hair looking smooth and shiny.

Because when hair is sleek and conditioned, it reflects more light, giving that beautiful shiny finish. Protect the health and shine of your hair with the Daily Shine Conditioner from Dove. Enriched with our Nutritive Serum, Dove Daily Shine Conditioner smooths over the strands' cuticles, leaving soft, silky hair with added strength and shine from the very first wash. All you need to do is, apply a small amount of conditioner to your hair from mid lengths to tips and rinse it off after a minute to get shiny and manageable hair, every day. And because we don't want daily wear and tear to get in the way of our shine, it protects hair from future damage, even from your brush. Not only does the formula give visible results after the first use, but it makes hair better*, making it look healthy. For hair that's soft, smooth and beautiful with every wash, Dove Daily Shine Conditioner is an ideal addition to your hair care routine. *Based on lab test with Dove Daily Shine System vs non-conditioning shampoo.",

A nourishing hand wash could help your skin turn soft and smooth.  •  That’s why we’ve created Dove Deeply Nourishing Hand Wash.  •  What makes Dove different? Dove hand wash cleanses your hands with a special formulation enriched with moisturizing cream to leave your hands soft and smooth and washes away germs.  •  Dove gently cleanses your skin while retaining its natural moisture rather than stripping it away like ordinary soaps, and in addition helps replenish nutrients that are lost during the cleansing process.  •  Just dispense a pump of this Dove Hand Wash into your hands and work into a rich lather before rinsing away.  •  Dove is pH neutral and has gentle cleansers.  •  It washes away germs and helps nourish and moisturize hands with every wash.  •  It is suitable for use on all skin types.  •  It is mild and hence suitable for dry and sensitive skin too.
